# Secure Communications SDK JS Tests

Included in this directory is a set of tests to fully test the SDK capabilities against an instance of SCS.

## Debugging (Capturing Requests)

In order to capture requests while running the tests, you will need to set two environment variables:
- GLOBAL_AGENT_HTTP_PROXY=<http://proxy-ip:port>
- NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0

Using the **global-agent** package, it will read the value of the GLOBAL_AGENT_HTTP_PROXY.  NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED allows the node process to ignore self-signed/expired certificate errors.
